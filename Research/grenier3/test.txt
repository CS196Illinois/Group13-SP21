# App/web dev, coding, machine learning etc. is very new to me so I chose to start with learning more front end concepts (HTML tutorial) to establish a good base to work 
from. As for research, I found this article about algorithmic trading using sentiment analysis. The guy who built the program used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for 
sEntiment Reasoning), a rule-based and lexicon analysis tool for determining sentiments in social media. In the MVP we wrote that we would likely be searching 
through twitter and Reddit, social medias that would be supported under VADER's service. Additionally, NLTK, the NLP tool, has a module for VADER. We can calculate a 
polarity score in each of the categories for being positive, neutral, negative, and a compound sentiment. The 5 main heuristics that are used are punctuation, capitalization, 
degree modifiers, conjunctions, and precedingTri-gram (identification of reverse polarity). As for finding which data to analyze, we could just search for 
keywords such as stock names and Given my limited experience and 
knowledge, I can't say if any of my research is viable.
