# PLAN

The group is planning to build a full-stack application to help analyze stock options and recommend the best option for the user to buy based on what category they are interested in.

## Front-End

For the front-end, we are planning to build a **React** application that will allow the user to choose a stock category and get the best option to buy. We plan to use **React-Router** to route between multiple pages.

## Back-End

For the back-end, we are planning to use a **Python** based framework that can take in stock data and implement custom algorithms using machine-learning that can help predict the best stock to buy, then send that imformation to the front-end.
